# Random-Maze-Generator

## What is it?

MazeBuilder.cs is a script to be run in the Unity Game Engine. It randomly generates a maze with a start and end point of any size (depending on the input parameters).
It can easily be edited for a wide variety of uses in various types of games. This script is merely a demonstration of the concept so that others can apply it to their own projects.
